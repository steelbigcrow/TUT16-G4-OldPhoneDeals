## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add admin phone detail types and API client method for GET `/api/admin/phones/{phoneId}` including seller info and status fields with failure handling.
- [x] 1.2 Build an admin phone detail page/route (e.g., `/admin/listings/:phoneId`) that fetches detail, renders title/brand/price/stock/status/seller/timestamps/image, and wires enable/disable plus delete actions with confirmations and notifications.
- [x] 1.3 Link listing rows/actions to the detail route and ensure admin guard/context protects the page.
- [x] 1.4 QA: run frontend lint/build if available and manually verify detail fetch, status toggle, and delete flows against the configured API base; update docs if env/config changes.
